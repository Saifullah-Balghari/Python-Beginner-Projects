    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of abstraction in programming.",
      "answer": "Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary functionalities to the user."

    {
      "question": "What is dynamic programming?",
      "answer": "Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to avoid redundant calculations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a deadlock?",
      "answer": "A deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?",
      "answer": "In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another in a sequential manner, while in asynchronous programming, tasks can be executed concurrently, allowing non-blocking operations."

      "answer": "A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, while a queue is a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a binary search tree?",
      "answer": "A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the value of each node is greater than the values of its left subtree and less than the values of its right subtree."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a database index?",
      "answer": "A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table by providing quick access to the rows based on the values of certain columns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a heap?",
      "answer": "A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node 'i' other than the root, the value of the parent node is greater (for a max heap) or lesser (for a min heap) than the value of its children."
